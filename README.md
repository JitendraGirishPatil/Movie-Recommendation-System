## Problem Statement
To build a Recommendation System which can recommend Movies based on the similarity of given movie.

## My Approach
This is a NLP model, so it utilises Cosine Similarity to get the best recommendations using vectors. The data is being cleaned first with punctuations, special characters, spaces, to lower case. Then the stop words were removed and the data is being tokenised.
